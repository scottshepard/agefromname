# Age from Name

This is a shiny app that uses Social Security Administration acturarial tables
and cencus data to find the median age of a given first name.

The idea is from the Five Thirty Eight article [How to Tell Someone's Name When All  
You Know is Her Age](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-tell-someones-age-when-all-you-know-is-her-name/#ss-2).

Data comes from Hadley Wickham's [babyname package](https://github.com/hadley/babynames).
